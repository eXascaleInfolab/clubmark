# (c) Network Specified by Links List format (NSL)
#
# \description The input Network (graph) is Specified by Links (Edges/Arcs),
# a generalization of NCOL format.
# Each line of the file defines edge of arc with optional weight.

# NSL[A,E] format specification:
# Comments are marked with '#' symbol and allowed only in the begin of the line
# Optional Header as a special comment:
# [Nodes: <nodes_num>[,]	<Links>: <links_num>[,] [Weighted: {0, 1}]]
# Note: the comma is either always present as a delimiter or always absent
# Body, links_num lines (not considering comments that might be present)
<src_id> <dst_id> [<weight>]
...
# where:
#  nodes_num  - the number of nodes (vertices) in the network (graph)
#  Links  - are either Edges (for the undirected network) or Arcs (for the directed network)
#  links_num  - the number of <links> (edges or arcs) in the network
#  weighted = {0, 1}  - whether the network is weighted or not, default: 1
#
#  src_id  - source node id >= 0
#  dst_id  - destination node id >= 0
#  weight  - weight in case the network is weighted, non-negative floating point number


# Example --------------------------------------------------------------
# = Example Network .nse (edges, undirected links) =
# Nodes: 3	Edges: 3   Weighted: 0 
# Note that the number of links corresponds to the number of payload lines in the file
0 1
# Empty lines and comments are allowed
0 2
2 1

# = Example Network .nsa (arcs - directed) =
# Nodes:3,  Arcs: 6,Weighted: 1
