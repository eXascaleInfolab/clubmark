# (c) Clusters Nodes List format (CNL)
#
# \description The clustering is specified by the single file, where
# each line corresponds to the cluster. The cluster consist of member
# nodes with possible overlaps (a node might belong to multiple
# clusters). Nodes a listed with space/tab separator and possible share
# in case the membership is not equal (fuzzy overlap).

# CNL format specification:
# Comments are marked with '#' symbol and allowed only in the begin of the line
# Optional Header as a special comment:
# [Clusters: <clusters_num>[,]  Nodes: <nodes_num>[,] [Fuzzy: {0, 1}]][,] [Numbered: {0, 1}]]
# Note: the comma is either always present as a delimiter or always absent
# The body consists of clusters_num lines (not considering comments that might be present)
# in the following format using a space delimiter:
# [<cl1_id>>] <nd1_id>[:<share1>] <nd2_id>[:<share1>] ...
# ...
# where:
#  clusters_num  - the number of *listed* clusters (the hierarchy itslef may contain more clusters)
#  nodes_num  - the number of DISTINCT nodes in all clusters
#  Fuzzy = {0, 1}  - whether the membership can be fuzzy (inequal) or not, default: 1
#  Numbered = {0, 1}  - whether the clusters are numbered, default: 0
#
#  cl_id  - cluster id, integer >=0, should form the solid range 0 .. clusters_num-1
#    if specified at all
#  nd_id  - node id, integer >=0
#  share  - membership share, non-negative floating point number E (0, 1]
# ATTENTION: all nodes in each cluster are unique (otherwise the file would consume more space
# 	and NMI evaluation would not work on standard tools), but the same node may occure in
# 	(be shared by) multiple clusters

# Examples -------------------------------------------------------------
# Overlapping fuzzy clustering consisting with the header
# Clusters: 4	 Nodes:5,Fuzzy: 1, Numbered: 1
# Note that the number of clusters corresponds to the number of payload lines in the file
0> 1 2:0.2
# Empty lines and comments are allowed
1> 2:0.3 3
2> 5 2:0.5 3
3> 3 4

# Example of the non-overlapping clustering consisting of 2 clusters and 5 nodes
# without the header and cluster identifiers
0 1
3 2 4
